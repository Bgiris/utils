# Kafka Local

Took it from [provectus/kafka-ui](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/blob/master/documentation/compose/kafka-ui.yaml) and made it lighter.

The original compose file has following extensions if you need moar:
- Connect
- Schema Registry
- Init topics
- Multiple kafka brokers/zookeepers
